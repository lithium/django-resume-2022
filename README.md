## My resume as a Django application

I wanted to author my resume in something that I could easily commit to GitHub, and deploy to Heroku.

I opted to include all data as hardcoded constants in fixedcontent.py so that data is included along with the code and 
can be reproduced in the future without requiring any database snapshots.
