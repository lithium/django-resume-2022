Setting it up in the office on an empty desk quickly dropped productivity of anyone within earshot. \r\n\r\nA new 50\" tv had just been installed in the office as well and nothing interesting had been visualized on it yet.\r\n\r\nI built this quick little django app, to allow untimed ffa multiplayer chess with board set up to do variants as well.  It ran on the Wall TV in the office for a few months and a few of us had a great time playing FFA chess matches and also experimenting and trying out different chess variants, like chaturaji or just building our own boards and layouts.",
